3. Whenever a feature must be done, create a new branch from development named: ft/<feature desc>
4. Branch examples: ft/create-product, ft/list-objects.
5. When work in a branch is done, create a pull request to development, in order to have your work reviewed and approved to merge with development.
6. When writing commits, use command: git commit -a to see what files you are commiting, and write a concise description of the work done with that commit.
